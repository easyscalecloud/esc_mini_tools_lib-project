# Project Automation Makefile
#
# This Makefile serves as a command-line system to perform common development
# operations for this project. It automatically resolves the correct Python
# interpreter and executes the appropriate scripts for each operation.
#
# Usage:
#   make <command>              # Run a specific command
#   make help                   # Show all available commands
#
# Python Environment:
# - Uses ~/.pyenv/shims/python for bootstrap and setup commands
# - Uses .venv/bin/python for project-specific operations
# - Automatically manages virtual environment and dependencies
#
# Command Categories:
# - ‚≠ê Essential commands for daily development
# - üèó Build and compilation operations
# - üöÄ Deployment operations
# - üí• Cleanup and removal operations
# - üõ† Configuration and setup operations
# - üóë Maintenance operations
